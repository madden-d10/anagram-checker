# anagram-checker
This is a NodeJS program for checking if two words are anagrams. Created for CME Group's Software Engineering Graduate programme.

# How to use
Pull down the repo and run in the terminal using ```node checker.js```

# Assumptions
* Entered values would be real words (however, even gibberish anagrams will be counted as valid).
* The requirement for a username meant that each user would have their own collection of anagrams.
* Entered words would be unique from each other.
